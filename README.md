## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
* Maven
* MySQL Server running locally
* A preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code with Java extensions)

### Database Configuration

1.  **Create a MySQL Database**:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE client_manager_db;
    ```
2.  **Configure `application.properties`**:
    Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties` and update the database connection details:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/client_manager_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # or create for first run, then update
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
    spring.thymeleaf.cache=false # For development, set to true for production
    ```
    * **Note**: `ddl-auto=update` will automatically create/update tables based on your JPA entities. For the very first run, you might set it to `create` and then change it back to `update` to prevent data loss on subsequent runs.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/client-management-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/client-management-system.git)
    cd client-management-system
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/client-management-system.git` with your actual repository URL)*

2.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the Spring Boot Application**:
    You can run it from your IDE or using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4.  **Access the Application**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```
